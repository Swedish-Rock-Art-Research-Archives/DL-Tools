<h1>Deep Learning and Data Processing Tools for Cultural Heritage</h1>
This repository contains tools developed by the Swedish Rock Art Research Archives and during the Tracing the Carvers project (University of Gothenburg).  The tools can be used in deep learning workflows and for pre-processing images and geospatial data to prepare training data. Some tools are stand-alone Python scripts, while others are for ArcGIS scripting tools (which require the ArcGIS Pro software).


<h2>Summary</h2>

* <b>RockArtAITools.zip</b>: ArcGIS Pro toolbox for all ArcGIS geoprocessing and script tools.

* <b>ExportTiledOBB.py</b>: ArcGIS Script Tool to tile large images and export YOLO OBB format labels from georeferenced rasters and shapefiles.

* <i>More coming soon...</i>
